When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The first thing that comes to mind is collaboration. When you work on some project in a team, it's critical to have some "centralized" repository that everyone can access and commit to. It'd very error-prone and tedious task to sync without some sort of a common repository, because in this case you would need to exchange files manually every time, decide who changed what and how to handle it, etc. Another example could be the case if you work on your project from different locations, like being on vacation or a trip. You might not have an access to your home machine with your local repository, but you can always pull the remote repository if you have a laptop and you remember your credentials :)
